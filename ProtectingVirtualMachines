# How I Protect Azure Virtual Machine Data

As a data protection professional I know a thing or two about file, folder, application, and machine-level backups. Providing data protection for a virtual machine in Azure is quite different than how you would perform a backup of an on-prem server or virtual machine. 

This is my first real security project involving Azure that I'm excited to share. A lot of components went into creating this SIEM and monitoring real-time brute-force attacks coming in from all over the globe against my poor little defenseless honeypot VM was nothing short of exhilarating!

Here's a visualization of what this process looks like. Not really much to look at yet but the interesting stuff is always found under the hood anyway, right?


This is only the start of a very intriguing foray into my Azure Security career and I'm glad I was able to share it here with a like-minded audience. I hope you enjoyed this experience as much as I did and I hope to have more interesting projects to share in the future!
